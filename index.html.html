            <h3 style="margin: 15px;">Interest in IT:</h3>
            Interest in IT started from playing on the family computer when I was little. Playing games, experiencing interfaces and the backdoor pathways and files. <br>
            Starting in year 9 (2017), I chose a coding and app design class as an elective, which continued onto VCE computing in year 10, followed by VCE software <br>
            development in year 11. I generally like to involve other outside interests, such as basketball, into my projects, as it adds further enjoyment and incentive to programming such projects. <br>
            I chose to attend RMIT due to its close proximity to myself, and its campus being inside the CBD. Another factor was the specialist nature of technology that RMIT brings, <br>
            further sparking my interest and later selection of RMIT as my preferred university. My expectations of education at RMIT are of subjects that help my employability into <br>
            a job in the field of IT, but also help develop any personal projects or ideas I may have. Which may further develop my interest or even income, stemming from IT. <br>
            Specifically I enjoy the programming aspects and creation of games, applications, or challenges. <br>

            <h3 style="margin: 15px;">Ideal Job:</h3>
            An Ideal job for myself would be a software engineer at a relatively new but established startup company, which would ideally be located in Melbourne. The position <br>
            would be a senior member on a team of developers creating an innovative digital product. The skills required for the job would be years of experience within the field, <br>
            alongside experience with specific development programs and languages. My current experience does not fit the required skills, as it isn’t an entry level job but rather <br>
            an experienced position. The acquisition of the required skills would be from a combination of higher level education, alongside experience in entry level IT jobs. <br>
            Also likely doing research and personal projects would help with this experience. <br>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Project Idea:</h2>
            My project idea involves my interest in sports, primarily Basketball, programming a simulation of a game/season/career. Simulating players strengths and weaknesses, <br>
            tendencies, and chemistry with teammates and potentially opponents. The project would have customizability, from being able to edit players, their attributes, tendencies, <br>
            number, description, etc. To also be able to create your own player, who would be drafted into the NBA, and be able to improve through training and experience. Furthermore, <br>
            I want it to also be open to expansion, adding features, and possibly other sporting leagues. <br>
            <br>
            My motivation for the creation of such a project is due to my interests in basketball and the NBA. Creating a basketball simulation also piques my interest as it is a realistic <br>
            project idea in which I either already have the tools and knowledge to create such a program, or I can learn the required skills and knowledge or acquire the right programming <br>
            tools and software. <br>
            <br>
            The project would start by creating the foundation of the entire project, simulating a singular basketball game. With the project initially being similar to that of a text based RPG. <br>
            The output would include the final score, along with the statistics of each individual player, which will be calculated with a mixture of RNG, and their attributes/tendencies. <br>
            This leads to the next step, which would be simulating an entire season, game by game. It would start with the focused team the user is viewing, then adding the simulation of background <br>
            games to further immerse the user. In between games, the user can have options to edit players in their team, changing attributes or tendencies of the players, or even changing the players <br>
            names and descriptions all together. After laying the groundwork for a working basketball game simulation, the next addition would be adding a sort of RPG career, in which the user can be <br>
            either a player entering the league, or the general manager of a franchise. Where they will have the freedom to edit the roster and develop players, but with realistic limitations. The <br>
            path where the user creates their own basketball player to enter the NBA will be customizable to what the user wants. And can control what type of player they become. <br>
            After the completion of the text based program, the next step is to add a simple user interface to the program, where there will be menus to guide the user to their intended place much <br>
            easier and more aesthetically pleasing than the text based system. The user interface will also include paths to quick play simulation games, along with fully customizable rosters, to <br>
            other game modes, such as both the player and general manager career. Included in the user interface will also have side panels, which will show stat leaders per game, and teams records in <br>
            the current season. These will change throughout the experience as games are played. <br>
            <br>
            The tools and technology used would likely be in a programming language such as Python, as it’s not only one of the most common and accessible languages, but also one I am currently learning <br>
            in another subject, ‘Introduction to Programming’. I would use software such as PyCharm, or VSCode to begin the project with, but possibly move to something else further down the track. <br>
            These two softwares are free and open to use. Storing the data used in the simulations could be stored in an SQL database, using an open software such as SQLiteStudio. <br>
            <br>
            The skills required would first be a moderately advanced Python knowledge and understanding, as the algorithms to create the software would be relatively complex after the foundations are set. <br>
            Also required would be some knowledge in database usage, and the SQL language, as they would also be used. <br>

            With the successful outcome of the project, the primary audience would be basketball fans. As it wouldn’t be a full game title, but rather a small simulation tool or widget. The project could <br>
            also be used as a base for further development if I ever desire to. To possibly practice other IT tools on, such as graphic creation and further database development, or practicing some <br>
            multiplayer aspects on it if I ever get into that section of IT. <br>
